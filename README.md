# Algorama

### The premiere outlet for algoing...

This repo is built for algorithm problems and practice, with the main goal being to hone my problem-solving methodogy. A list of all the algorithms is below, grouped by category.

## The Problems

(E) === Easy, (M) === Medium, (H) === Hard

- Roman Numerals to Integers (E)
- Longest Uncommon Substring (M)
- Are these Strings Isomorphic? (M)
- Number of Matching Subsequences (M)
- Needle in a Haystack (E)
- All Permuations of a string (M)

### Linked Lists

- Swap Nodes (M)
- Reverse a Linked List (E)
- Is there a loop in this Linked List? (E).
  - Tortoise and the Hare method
- Remove Duplicates (E)
- Remove All Targeted Values from a Linked List (E)
- Merge a Sorted Linked List (M)
- Remove nth Node (M)
- Do They Merge? (E)

### Array Manipulation

- Binary Search (E)

### Graphs

You can require a bi-directional Graph creator from ./simpleGraph for testing purposes using -----> const graph = require('./simpleGraph')

- Simple Graph Implementation (E)
