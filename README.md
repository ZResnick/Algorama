# Algoram

### The premiere outlet for algoing...

This repo is built for algorithm problems and practice, eith thre main goal being to hone my problem-solving methodogy. A list of all the algorithms is below, grouped by data structure.

## The Problems

(E) === Easy, (M) === Medium, (H) === Hard

### String Manipulation

- Roman Numerals to Integers (E)
- Longest Uncommon Substring (M)
- Are these Strings Isomorphic? (M)

### Linked Lists

- Swap Nodes (M)
- Reverse a Linked List (E)
- Is there a loop in this Linekd List? (E).
  - Tortoise and the Hare method
- Remove Duplicates (EE)
- Remove All Targeted Values from a Linked List (E)
- Merge a Sorted Linked List (M)

### Array Manipulation

- Binary Search (E)
- Minimum Jumps to end of Array (M)

### Binary Trees

Note you can require a BST creator from ./treeCreator for testing purposes using -----> const bst = require('./treeCreator')

- Simple Binary Search (E)
- Merge Binary Trees (E)
- Max Depth of a Binary Tree
